It marks my work anniversary for an industry leading application security company on 26th July 2023.

A great company to work with is hard to find, which with good work culture, team works, and team members are harder to come by. 

<span class="spoiler">F5, a multinational corporation,</span> is going through a transformation of hardware-led to a software-led company since 2017.

#### My first project

What a remarkable experience gained, when embarking my very first project in the company, which happens in conjunction of Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October for GovWare 2022.

First, a promotional video was created and published prior to the event broadcasting our cross-collaboration showcases during GovWare 2022, which in partnership with Dell, Sentient.io, NCS, and NTT.

During the GovWare event days, few videos were create to boost showcase awareness and coverage for our customers and prospects to visit our booth and learn more about our industry leading solution showcases.
